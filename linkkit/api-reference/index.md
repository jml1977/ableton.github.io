### Introduction

Cross-device shared tempo and quantized beat grid API for iOS.

Provides zero configuration peer discovery on a local wired or wifi network between multiple instances running on multiple devices. When peers are connected in a link session, they share a common tempo and quantized beat grid.

Each instance of the library has its own beat timeline that starts when the library is initialized and runs until the library instance is destroyed. Clients can reset the beat timeline in order to align it with an app's beat position when starting playback.

#### `ABLLinkRef`

Reference to an instance of the library.

<code class="is-block"><span>typedef struct ABLLink*</span> ABLLinkRef;</code>

#### `ABLLinkSessionTempoCallback`

Called if Session Tempo changes.

<code class="is-block"><span>typedef void</span> ( <span>*</span>ABLLinkSessionTempoCallback)(
    <span>double</span> sessionTempo,
    <span>void *</span>context);
</code>

**Parameters:**

- `sessionTempo`: User-visible representation of the session tempo as described in [`ABLLinkGetSessionTempo`](#abllinkgetsessiontempo)

#### `ABLLinkIsEnabledCallback`

Called if isEnabled state changes.

<code class="is-block"><span>typedef void</span> ( *ABLLinkIsEnabledCallback)(
    <span>bool</span> isEnabled,
    <span>void</span> *context);
</code>

**Parameters:**

- `isEnabled`: Whether Link is currently enabled

#### `ABLLinkNew`

Initialize the library, providing an initial tempo.

<code class="is-block"><span>ABLLinkRef</span> ABLLinkNew(
    <span>double</span> initialBpm);
</code>

#### `ABLLinkDelete`

Destroy the library instance and cleanup its associated resources.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkDelete(
    ABLLinkRef);
</code>

#### `ABLLinkSetActive`

Set whether Link should be active or not.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkSetActive(
    ABLLinkRef,
    <span>bool</span> active);
</code>

When Link is active, it advertises itself on the local network and initiates connections with other peers. It is active by default after init.

#### `ABLLinkIsEnabled`

Is Link currently enabled by the user?

<code class="is-block"><span>bool</span> ABLLinkIsEnabled(
    ABLLinkRef);
</code>

The enabled status is only controllable by the user via the Link settings dialog and is not controllable programmatically.

#### `ABLLinkIsConnected`

Is Link currently connected to other peers?

<code class="is-block"><span>bool</span> ABLLinkIsConnected(
    ABLLinkRef);
</code>

#### `ABLLinkSetSessionTempoCallback`

Invoked on the main thread when the tempo of the Link session changes.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkSetSessionTempoCallback(
    ABLLinkRef,
    <span>ABLLinkSessionTempoCallback</span> callback,
    <span>void</span> *context);
</code>

#### `ABLLinkSetIsEnabledCallback`

Invoked on the main thread when the user changes the enabled state of the library via the Link settings view.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkSetIsEnabledCallback(
    ABLLinkRef,
    <span>ABLLinkIsEnabledCallback</span> callback,
    <span>void</span> *context);
</code>

#### `ABLLinkSetIsConnectedCallback`

Invoked on the main thread when the isConnected state of the library changes.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkSetIsConnectedCallback(
    ABLLinkRef,
    <span>ABLLinkIsConnectedCallback</span> callback,
    <span>void</span> *context);
</code>

#### `ABLLinkCaptureAudioTimeline`

Capture the current Link timeline from the audio thread.

<code class="is-block"><span>ABLLinkTimelineRef</span> ABLLinkCaptureAudioTimeline(
    ABLLinkRef);
</code>

This function is lockfree and should ONLY be called in the audio thread. It must not be accessed from any other threads. The returned reference refers to a snapshot of the current Link state, so it should be captured and used in a local scope. Storing the Timeline for later use in a different context is not advised because it will provide an outdated view on the Link state.

####`ABLLinkCommitAudioTimeline`

Commit the given timeline to the Link session from the audio thread.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkCommitAudioTimeline(
    ABLLinkRef,
    ABLLinkTimelineRef);
</code>

This function is lockfree and should ONLY be called in the audio thread. The given timeline will replace the current Link timeline. Modifications to the session based on the new timeline will be communicated to other peers in the session.

####`ABLLinkCaptureAppTimeline`

Capture the current Link timeline from the main application thread.

<code class="is-block"><span>ABLLinkTimelineRef</span> ABLLinkCaptureAppTimeline(
    ABLLinkRef);
</code>

This function provides the ability to query the Link timeline from the main application thread and should only be used from that thread. The returned Timeline stores a snapshot of the current Link state, so it should be captured and used in a local scope. Storing the Timeline for later use in a different context is not advised because it will provide an outdated view on the Link state.

####`ABLLinkCommitAppTimeline`

Commit the timeline to the Link session from the main application thread.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkCommitAppTimeline(
    ABLLinkRef,
    ABLLinkTimelineRef);
</code>

This function should ONLY be called in the main thread. The given timeline will replace the current Link timeline. Modifications to the session based on the new timeline will be communicated to other peers in the session.

####`ABLLinkGetTempo`

The tempo of the given timeline, in Beats Per Minute.

<code class="is-block"><span>double</span> ABLLinkGetTempo(
  ABLLinkTimelineRef);
</code>

This is a stable value that is appropriate for display to the user. Beat time progress will not necessarily match this tempo exactly because of clock drift compensation.

####`ABLLinkSetTempo`

Set the timeline tempo to the given bpm value, taking effect at the given host time.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkSetTempo(
    ABLLinkTimelineRef,
    <span>double</span> bpm,
    <span>uint64_t</span> hostTimeAtOutput);
</code>

####`ABLLinkBeatTimeAtHostTime`

Get the beat value corresponding to the given host time for the given quantum.

<code class="is-block"><span>double</span> ABLLinkBeatTimeAtHostTime(
    ABLLinkTimelineRef,
    <span>uint64_t</span> hostTimeAtOutput,
    <span>double</span> quantum);
</code>

The magnitude of the resulting beat value is unique to this Link instance, but its phase with respect to the provided quantum is shared among all session peers. For non-negative beat values, the following property holds: fmod(ABLLinkBeatTimeAtHostTime(tl, ht, q), q) == ABLLinkPhaseAtTime(tl, ht, q).

####`ABLLinkHostTimeAtBeatTime`

Get the host time at which the sound corresponding to the given beat time and quantum reaches the device's audio output.

<code class="is-block"><span>uint64_t</span> ABLLinkHostTimeAtBeatTime(
    ABLLinkTimelineRef,
    <span>double</span> beatTime,
    <span>double</span> quantum);
</code>

The inverse of ABLLinkBeatTimeAtHostTime, assuming a constant tempo.
<code>ABLLinkBeatTimeAtHostTime(tl, *ABLLinkHostTimeAtBeatTime(tl, b, q), q) == b</code>

####`ABLLinkPhaseAtTime`

Get the phase for a given beat time value on the shared beat grid with respect to the given quantum.

<code class="is-block"><span>double</span>ABLLinkPhaseAtTime(
    ABLLinkTimelineRef,
    <span>uint64_t</span> hostTimeAtOutput,
    <span>double</span> quantum);
</code>

This function allows access to the phase of a host time as described above with respect to a quantum. The returned value will be in the range [0, quantum].

####`ABLLinkRequestBeatAtTime`

Attempt to map the given beat time to the given host time in the context of the given quantum.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkRequestBeatAtTime(
    ABLLinkTimelineRef,
    <span>double</span> beatTime,
    <span>uint64_t</span> hostTimeAtOutput,
    <span>double</span> quantum);
</code>

This function behaves differently depending on the state of the session. If no other peers are connected, then this instance is in a session by itself and is free to re-map the beat/time relationship whenever it pleases.
If there are other peers in the session, this instance should not abruptly re-map the beat/time relationship in the session because that would lead to beat discontinuities among the other peers. In this case, the given beat will be mapped to the next time value greater than the given time with the same phase as the given beat.
This function is specifically designed to enable the concept of "quantized launch" in client applications. If there are no other peers in the session, then an event (such as starting transport) happens immediately when it is requested. If there are other peers, however, we wait until the next time at which the session phase matches the phase of the event, thereby executing the event in-phase with the other peers in the session. The client only needs to invoke this method to achieve this behavior and should not need to explicitly check the number of peers.

####`ABLLinkForceBeatAtTime`

Rudely re-map the beat/time relationship for all peers in a session.

<code class="is-block"><span>void</span> ABLLinkForceBeatAtTime(
    ABLLinkTimelineRef,
     <span>double</span> beatTime,
     <span>uint64_t</span> hostTimeAtOutput,
     <span>double</span> quantum);
</code>

DANGER: This function should only be needed in certain special circumstances. Most applications should not use it. It is very similar to ABLLinkRequestBeatAtTime except that it does not fall back to the quantizing behavior when it is in a session with other peers. Calling this method will unconditionally map the given beat time to the given host time and broadcast the result to the session. This is very anti-social behavior and should be avoided.
One of the few legitimate uses of this method is to synchronize a Link session with an external clock source. By periodically forcing the beat/time mapping according to an external clock source, a peer can effectively bridge that clock into a Link session. Much care must be taken at the application layer when implementing such a feature so that users do not accidentally disrupt Link sessions that they may join.

## ABLLinkSettingsViewController.h
Copyright 2016, Ableton AG, Berlin. All rights reserved.

#### `ABLLinkSettingsViewController : UIViewController`

Settings view controller that provides users with the ability to view Link status and modify Link-related settings. Clients can integrate this view controller into their GUI as they see fit, but it is recommended that it be presented as a popover.

#### `+instance:`

Class method that provides an instance of the view controller given an ABLLink instance.

<code class="is-block">+ (<span>id</span>)instance:(<span>ABLLinkRef</span>)ablLink;
</code>

Clients must ensure that the ABLLink instance is not destroyed before the view controller.
